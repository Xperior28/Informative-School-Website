            <p>Greenwood High believes in the principle that a good liberal education is a participative process, in which the child is a key participant. In keeping with the spirit of this principle, we will interact with the child in combination with a written exercise .This will facilitate us in understanding the child’s readiness for the class to which you have applied. The Principal will meet the parent with the child and on his approval parents can proceed with the admission.</p>

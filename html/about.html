                    <h1>Fiama High School ICSE</h1>
                    <p>Fiama High offers ICSE as well as the International Primary Years Program. The school envisions the students to become moral, empathetic, and socially responsible citizens of the century, who are rooted to their culture and are ready to accept any new challenges with a fresh approach towards learning. And to attain this, the school identifies multiple intelligences and offers theme-based learning, concept-based learning, exploration based, student centric learning, as well as differentiated learning for students of various abilities. 

                        Fiama High students not only balance academics, sports, and co-curricular activities, but excel in them.  Fiama High results far outshine the world average; the school has produced India toppers in ICSE.  And yet, these very same industrious students immerse themselves in theatre and with support from their theatre, art, and music teachers, and have presented ‘Annie’ a musical that was compared to professional theatre productions.  To encourage them further, the school has held various workshops including one from the prestigious Globe Education.
                        
                        The students are artists, musicians, sports champions and MUN experts.  But all, they are concerned global citizens.  </p>

                <div class="part-2">
                    <p>The CAS students volunteer in hospitals, paint government run schools for the underprivileged, create breast cancer awareness, clean streets, and recycle waste. They raise funds for education and health in rural areas. The sports enthusiasts organized ‘Run in the Sun’, to encourage a healthy lifestyle and donated the entire proceeds to improve the quality of sports in India, and to increase awareness about juvenile diabetes.

                        The students of Fiama High aim high, and reach higher, for many have been accepted in Ivy League colleges, with scholarships.  Indeed, they all take the school motto ‘Rooted in Knowledge’ very seriously, and while spreading out their wings to soar high, remain rooted deeply in knowledge.</p>
